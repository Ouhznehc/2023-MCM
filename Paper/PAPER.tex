\begin{abstract}
    Sailboats fulfill diverse roles, fueling a thriving secondary market. Brokers, facing numerous complex factors, struggle to determine reasonable pricing. A tool to assist in comprehensive evaluations and rational pricing for used boats is urgently needed.
    
    This paper aims to construct a reliable model based on existing datasets, which can provide a reasonable explanation for the pricing of the second-hand sailboat market. It also analyzes the impact of different factors and indicators on prices. Finally, the model will be applied to the second-hand sailboat market in Hong Kong to provide a reasonable and accurate pricing rule.

After that, a memo is attached.

\section{Introduction}
% 问题背景
\subsection{Background}
In our daily lives, sailboats are not only a means of transportation, but also serve as leisure and entertainment, and even for competitive sports. As a result, the growing demand for sailboats has given rise to a thriving boat market, which has gradually developed into a secondary market. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers usually trade through brokers, who play a crucial role in the transaction process.

For brokers, it is essential to be familiar with the used sailboat market, comprehensively consider various factors, and make reasonable pricing for the used sailboats in order to facilitate a successful transaction. However, the factors affecting the price of used sailboats are numerous and complex, with different brands, variants of boats, years, depreciation rates, as well as local consumption levels and geographical environments having significant impacts. The intertwined influences of these complex factors make it difficult to determine the pricing in the used sailboat market, and it is challenging to come up with a reasonable price that takes all factors into account.

Therefore, brokers urgently need a tool to assist them in making more reasonable and comprehensive evaluations of used sailboats, and to make the pricing in the used sailboat market more rational.

\subsection{Problem Restatement}
\textbf{Problem (a) :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a prediction model to explain the listing price of each of the sailboats in the provided spreadsheet.
    \item Discuss the precision of our estimate for each sailboat variant's price.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem (b) :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine whether region has an impact on the price of second-hand boats and explain the effect.
    \item Discuss whether any regional effect is consistent across all sailboat variants.
    \item Address the practical and statistical significance of any regional effects noted.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem (c) :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on the model, find out how it can be useful in the Hong Kong market.
    \item Choose one subset and model the regional effect of Hong Kong on each sailboat prices.
    \item Assess whether  the effect is the same for both catamarans and monohull sailboats.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem (d) :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify and discuss additional informative conclusions drawn from the data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem (e) :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a one-to two-page report with well-chosen graphics to assist the Hong Kong sailboat broker to understand your findings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions and Justififications}
% 问题假设
\subsection{Assumptions}
To simplify our problems, we make the following basic assumptions, each of which is
adequately justified.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The price of used sailboats is solely determined by the factors in the dataset.
    \item The factors in the dataset are independent and unrelated.
    \item The data in the dataset are all real, reasonable, and follow a certain pattern.
    \item The pricing required by a broker should be reasonable and in accordance with market rules, rather than false pricing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Exploration}
\subsection{Data Cleaning}
First of all, we turn the \textbf{\texttt{xlsx}} format data sheet into \textbf{\texttt{csv}} format. 
The conversion causes some minor errors like extra spaces and unexcepted characters which can be easily filtered out by text editor and python string operating functions like \textbf{\texttt{strip()}} or so.

Secondly, we use \textbf{Linear interpolation} to fill in the missing data and then apply \textbf{Adaptive Density-Based Clustering} for spell correction,
resulting in a more complete and accurate dataset than the original.

Finally, we merge the corrected dataset with the accurate one after making necessary modifications.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{error_data.png}
    \caption{Examples of error data}\label{fig:error_data}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
We collect and organize more additional features of a given sailboat(such as \textbf{beam}, \textbf{draft}, \textbf{displacement}, \textbf{cabins}, etc.),
and the \textbf{2020 per capita GDP data} of the relevant regions, 
greatly enriching the diversity of the data and expanding the dataset size. 
These efforts lay a solid foundation for subsequent modeling.

In the memo, we want to introduce you an alternate typesetting program to the prevailing MS Word: \textbf{\LaTeX}. In fact, the history of \LaTeX\ is even longer than that of MS Word. In 1970s, the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth first came out with a typesetting program, which named \TeX\ \ldots

Firstly, \ldots

Secondly, \ldots

Lastly, \ldots

According to all those mentioned above, it is really worth to have a try on \LaTeX!
